Flask Web Application Exercise: User Feedback Form
Objective:
Build a small web application using Flask that collects user feedback via a form. Once the user submits the form, they will be redirected to the homepage, where they can submit the form again or view a confirmation message that their feedback was received.

Requirements:
Home Page:

Create a home page that welcomes the user.
The home page should have a button labeled "Submit Feedback" that takes the user to the feedback form.
Feedback Form:

Create a form where users can submit their name, email address, and feedback message.
The form should have the following fields:
Name: A text input field for the user to provide their name.
Email: An email input field.
Feedback Message: A text area for the user to write their feedback.
Include a Submit button.
Form Handling:

When the form is submitted, the server should:
Process the form data.
Store the feedback temporarily (you don't need to store it in a databaseâ€”just display it after submission).
Redirect the user back to the homepage after submission.
Home Page After Form Submission:

After submitting the form, redirect the user to the home page.
Display a message on the home page, such as "Thank you, [Name]! Your feedback has been submitted."
Bonus (Optional):
Add basic form validation to ensure that all fields are filled in before submission.
Use CSS to style the form and make the pages look more visually appealing.
Instructions:
Set up your Flask app:

Create a Python file named app.py for your Flask app.
Create two HTML files: home.html and form.html, and place them in a templates folder.
Flask Routing:

Create routes for the home page (/) and the form page (/feedback).
Handle both GET and POST requests for the form submission.
Redirect and Form Handling:

When the form is submitted, process the form data and redirect the user to the home page.
Show a message on the home page thanking the user for their feedback.
Test the Application:

Run the Flask app and test it in your web browser by going to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
